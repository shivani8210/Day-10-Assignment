Q3) Explain abstract class and interface with an example.

Ans- Abstract class: It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It doesn't support multiple inheritance. It can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. It can provide the implementation of interface. The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class. It can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces. It can be extended using keyword "extends". A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc. 

Example:

public abstract class Shape {

	public abstract void draw();
	
} 

	 Interface: It can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also. It supports multiple inheritance. It has only static and final variables. It can't provide the implementation of abstract class. The interface keyword is used to declare interface. It can extend another Java interface only. It can be implemented using keyword "implements". Members of a Java interface are public by default.
	 
Example:

public interface Drawable {

	void draw();
	
}
